While shooting a band I saw a tall guy approaching the pit, with a tone of gear hanging his waist. Not far behind was a lady, with quite the same equipment. I was blown away. I knew they weren't there to cover the festival, but what were they there for?</p>",
            "<p>Naturally, I asked them what were they doing, and the lady was more inclined to tell me their story. After a couple of minutes, she told me she grew up in Romania. She came to Romanian to show her husband where she was born. We kept talking about their journey when out of a sudden, her husband handed me 'hand sanitizer'. </p>",
            "<p>It wasn't originally intended to be used that way, but it could be very well. The bottle was containing a very strong alcohol-based drink, called 'tuica' - a traditional drink from Romania. This simple act of sharing touched me like nothing has touched me before when meeting some people. We are offering 'tuica' at feasts, or to welcome someone at our table. He was not speaking my language, yet he found a way to communicate with me in a manner he saw here, on these lands. </p>",

            "<p>After bumpy trip to Bontida, the festival site, I started following the signs towards the organizer's tent. As I was waiting in line to get my badge, I started chatting with some friends, and the conversation went long after a young lady started to ask my credentials. When she asked me what type of badge I need, I replied simply that I wanted <i>a photo badge</i>, and went on. It took me 30 seconds to realize I've got a kick-ass badge, a stunning piece of plastic.</p>",
            "<p>The badges I got until then were arguably ugly. As they were designing them to indirectly tell you how much access you got. I bet there was a jinn whispering 'hehe, wait to see what's coming for you'. The first day went pretty fast and I never got the chance to access the main stage. All the bands I was interested in photographing were on the second stage, the air-shed. That's the great thing about planning what you want to cover.</p>",
            "<p>On the second day I wanted to cover the band I stared photography, Alternosfera. I went to the main stage access area, waiting for the band to begin. The security searched me for a rough edge, but I was sure I had the right type of access, so I insisted. I felt relief when I stepped foot on the channel connecting the sound tent with the pit area.</p>",
            "<p>Remember when I was telling you that a badge tells you how much access you get?</p> <p>Yeah, right..</p> <p>After a while, all those who were the lucky owners of a black & yellow badge got an upgrade to a black & yellow (+) magenta sticker. Life was telling me that my access just got restricted.</p> <p>Even so, I was determined to figure it out. I went to the main stage, got rejected by the security as I wasn't upgraded to the new color scheme and I started to ask questions. The type of answer I got was 'Find R, she'll tell you what to do'. So I went searching for someone named R. You won't believe it when I tell you I found them, but they told me to 'find A'. </p> <p>So I did.</p>",
            "<p>Let's wrap it up. I found T, and he asked me what was going on with my badge. He told me that I got the wrong one. It was meant for the photo crew, not for photo press.</p> <p>Oh, snap!</p> <p>So that's why I missed the upgrade. To be honest, I got it when I started to run around after the alphabet, but you cannot judge me for my curiosity. I told T that the young lady from the first tent gave it to me. T corrected the mistake in less than 10 seconds. <i>You give me that one, I give you this one - non-negotiable.</i></p> <p>You might think that it was restricting me even more, but the badge only had the third color scheme. I asked for it and I knew I'll learn something, retrospectively, but it wasn't refreshing.</p>",
            "<p>This story is not about breaking the rules. I am an obedient person, but a curious one. I followed the rules, and even pointed to a flow in their organization. I wanted to see how this situation is evolving. Throughout this journey, I learned how to communicate with those organizing the festival, met the artists and improved my skills.</p>",
            "<p>The first picture you see in this post was shot from the crowd, a few moments after I got pulled out from the mosh pit. Would it be better framed if I were in the pit?</p> <p>Yes, most probably. </p> But let me ask you something. How often have you been pulled out from the mosh pit by two guys yelling 'This one is a photographer', squeezed against the baricades yelling at the security agent to let you, somehow, leave that spot as you were carying expensive gear, and yet tell the world to go to hell and continue taking pictures? Not often I guess. </p> <p> Use your time wisely, don't waste it for someone's approval.</p>"

Hah, of course! </p> <p>Before that I tought I met frendly people. Oh, dear! I still remember that Vlad said at one point that he lives for 'piscotareala'.
